        This official set of rules is called rollover where five fingers are
        subtracted should a hand's sum exceeds 5 as described below.
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A hand is live if it has at least one finger, and this is indicated by
          raising at least one finger. If a hand has zero fingers, the hand is
          dead, and this is indicated by raising zero fingers (i.e. a closed
          fist).
        </li>
        <li>
          If any hand of any player reaches exactly five fingers, then the hand
          is dead.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each player begins with one finger raised on each hand. After the
          first player turns proceed clockwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          On a player's turn, they must either attack or split. There are two
          types of splits, transfers and divisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          To attack, a player uses one of their live hands to strike an
          opponent's live hand. The number of fingers on the opponent's struck
          hand will increase by the number of fingers on the hand used to
          strike.
        </li>
        <li>
          To transfer, a player strikes their own two hands together, and
          transfers raised fingers from one hand to the other as desired.
          However, a player cannot transfer fingers to make a hand have more
          than 4 fingers.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a player has a dead hand, the player can divide the fingers between
          the other hand and the dead hand by transferring fingers from the
          other hand to the dead hand.
        </li>
        <li>A player with two dead hands is eliminated from the game.</li>
        <li>A player wins once all opponents are eliminated.</li>
        <li>
          If you go over 5 you subtract the sum of all of the numbers by 5
        </li>
        <li>
          Higher finger value is represented in the 2nd hand of the player at
          all times.
        </li>
      </ul>
